title: "GCP AI Study Jam: My Journey and Key Takeaways"

Late to the party, but I made it 🔥🧑‍💻

🔎 What the most valuable thing I learned from this event?
I’d say it’s managing GCP services and configs via the console. I also got exposed to some Linux commands I had never used before — including all the gcloud commands (which at first it literally has numerous amount of arguments 😅, and yes it is). This turned out to be a great alternative way of learning Linux basics like ls, cat, grep, and curl (+ many many more), alongside Google Cloud’s own gcloud commands.

🔎 What about the other lessons I picked up from this event?
Good question. Here are some of the key takeaways:
✏️ Gaining the ability to flexibly de-identify sensitive data using DLP API and KMS API.
✏️ Interacting with Cloud Vision API, Cloud Translation API, and Cloud Natural Language API to perform machine learning tasks in the cloud.
✏️ Experimenting with #Gemini and #Imagen to build real-world applications.

Time for a short break 🍵 See you again!

Sorry, I'm a nano guy not a vim guy 😅
