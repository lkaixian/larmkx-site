First of all, I'm truly grateful to have been selected for the opportunity to participate in the ARM-MY On-Demand Training, a 3 day program hosted by Arm in collaboration with ASEM - Advanced Semiconductor Academy of Malaysia, held from 28 July 2025 to 30 July 2025 at Monash University Malaysia. 
This marked my first in-depth exposure to the ARM architecture and its ecosystem. 

ðŸ§ Day 1: Introduction of ARM Architecture & Profiles
- âœ¨ARM (Advanced RISC Machine) licensing it's own ISA and CPU designs rather than making the chip.
- âœ¨ARM's family consists of A-profile (Application profile), R-profile (Real-time profile), M-profile (Microcontroller profile) and Neoverse.
- âœ¨ Biggest difference between ARMv8-a and ARMv9-a is ARMv8-a introduce 64-bit computation while ARMv9-a introduce enhancement of security and AI/ML capabilities.
- âœ¨ big.LITTLE architecture consists of mix of big and little cores whereas  #DynamIQ architecture are more integrated, removal of L3 cache and replace with DynamIQ Shared Unit (DSU).
- âœ¨ #AMBA Tree Protocol is ARM's Interconnect where it has numbers of protocols used for communication. Think of them like types of road and number of lanes.

ðŸ§ Day 2: SoC Design & ARM System IP
- âœ¨General SoC Design flow is as below:
Architecture definition (requirements, PPA) â†’ IP integration (RTL & EDA tools) â†’ RTL design & verification (testbench, constraints) â†’ Software co-development (drivers) â†’ Backend Implementation (floor planning) â†’ Tape-out â†’ Validation â†’ Mass production.
- âœ¨The Core ARM SoC components consists of ARM CPUs, the memory subsystem, AMBA Interconnect, System IP, I/O, NPU, and PCM (Power & Clock management)
- âœ¨Introduction of ARM  #Corstone SubSystems - prebuilt SoC templates. (Corstone-1000)

ðŸ§  Day 3: AI and ML with ARM
- âœ¨ Introduction of ARM  #Ethos-U Series NPU - perform from basic CNN to Transformers by offloading NN ops from Cortex-M using ARM  #TOSA (Tensor Operator Set Architecture)
- âœ¨Introduction of  #Vela compiler where it optimize TFLu (TensorflowLite micro) for NPU execution.
- âœ¨ Optimization of LLM including Quantization, distillation, pruning, and using DAG (Dynamic Graph - TF 2) or Eager Mode (TF 1)
- âœ¨ Optimization of Matrix including loop tiling, reordering, loop unrolling and multicore parallelism.

There's still a lot more to cover and so far I had done summary for the 1st day. Special thanks to:
- Blade Lin for detailed explanation (especially on differences between GIC and NVIC in terms of speed and ARM Kleidi framework on SLAM application) and advices.
- Tsung-Chih (Alex) Su for detailed explanation (especially on difference between DMA and SMMU and efficiency on using JIT on DAC) and advices.
- Niki Dow, Graciela Lin, and Jessica Wu for the amazing advices during panel discussion. 
- CK Tseng for the thrilling opening speechðŸ”¥

In short, this marked as the first step for the in-depth exploration of ARM's ecosystem. Hope you find this post insightful.
